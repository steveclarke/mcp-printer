## Common Issues

**"Package name taken"**
If `mcp-printer` is taken, try:
- `@yourusername/mcp-printer` (scoped)
- `mcp-cups-printer`
- `printer-mcp-server`

**"Need to be logged in"**
Run: `pnpm login` and enter credentials

**"402 Payment Required"**
You need to upgrade npm account or use scoped package `@username/mcp-printer`

**Note:** pnpm publishes to the same npm registry, so all npm packages work with pnpm!

**"Forbidden"**
Package name might be reserved. Try a different name.

**Remember:** Publishing is permanent! You can't unpublish after 72 hours.
Test thoroughly before publishing!

**Using pnpm:** This project uses pnpm, but publishes to npm registry. Users can install with npm, pnpm, or yarn.
