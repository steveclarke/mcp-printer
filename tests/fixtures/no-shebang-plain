Test Fixture: Plain Text File Without Shebang
==============================================

This file has no extension and no shebang.
It should NOT be auto-detected as code.

This is just a plain text document that happens to have no file extension.
It should be printed as plain text, not rendered with syntax highlighting.

Project Notes
-------------

1. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
2. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
3. The system should handle files without extensions gracefully.

Important Considerations:
- Not all files without extensions are code files
- Some are just plain text documents
- License files, READMEs, and changelogs often lack extensions
- The shebang detection helps distinguish executable scripts

Example without code:
If this were code, it would look different.
But it's not, so it doesn't.

Final Notes:
This file serves as a control case for our shebang detection feature.
It ensures we don't accidentally render plain text files as code just
because they lack a file extension.
